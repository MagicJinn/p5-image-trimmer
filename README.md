# p5 Image Trimmer

Trim the edges of your images in bulk with this program

## This is an unrefined version of my p5 image trimmer. Use this program to trim the edges off your images in bulk

I might update the program to make it more beginner friendly in the future. Until then, I hope my comments will do. Editing the code will be required to get the functionality you desire.

## Hints

- Use a bulk renamer to name all images `image{index}` (image0,image1, etc.)
- Images can be different sizes.
- Easiest way to run the program is through the live server feature in VSCode
- Images will ALWAYS be saved to the default downloads folder. Put all files there in a temporary folder just in case.
